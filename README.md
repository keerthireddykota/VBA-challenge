**VBA-Challenge**

This VBA script analyzes stock data for each quarter and outputs the following information:

Ticker symbol
Quarterly change
Percentage change
Total stock volume
The script also returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The script is designed to run on every worksheet (i.e., every quarter) at once.

Limitations:

The script assumes that the input data is in a specific format and located in a specific range. If the data is not in the expected format or location, the script may not work as intended.

Troubleshooting:

If the script does not work as expected, check the following:

Make sure the input data is in the expected format and location.
Make sure the VBA script is inserted into a new module in the VBA editor.
Make sure the StockAnalysis macro is selected and run from the Macro dialog box.
